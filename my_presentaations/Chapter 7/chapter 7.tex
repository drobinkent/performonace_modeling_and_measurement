\begin{itemize}
\item Let, $D_i$ =  total service demand on device $i$ for all visits of a single job (i.e., a single interaction). That is,
$$D_i = {{\sum}_{j=1}}^{V_i} {S_i}^{(j)}$$
${S_i}^{(j)}$ = service time required by the $j$ th visit of the job to server $i$
\item  assuming that the number of visits a job makes to device i is not affected by its service demand at the device.
$$E [D_i ] = E [V_i ] \cdot E [S_i ]$$

\item \textbf{Bottleneck Law} 
$$ {\rho}_i = X \cdot E[D_i] $$

\item  \textbf{Explanation}: $X$ jobs/sec arriving into system. Each  arrivals
into the system contributes $E [D_i ]$ seconds of work for device $i$. So device i is busy for $X \cdot E [D_i ]$ seconds out of every second (e.g., device i might be busy for half a second
out of every second). 

Thus $X \cdot E [D_i ]$ represents the utilization of device i.
