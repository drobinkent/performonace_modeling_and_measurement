\section{Classiﬁcation of Queueing Networks}

    \frametitle{Classiﬁcation of Queueing Networks}
    \framesubtitle{\textbf{\textit{Open Networks}}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item open queueing network has external arrivals and departures
		\item Example
			\begin{itemize}
			\item CPU uses a time-sharing scheduler to serve a queue of jobs waiting for CPU time
			\item Router in a network serves a queue of packets waiting to be routed.
			\end{itemize}
		\item Queueing theory is built on  \textbf{\textit{stochastic modeling and analysis}} 						\begin{itemize}
					\item Model and analyze  service demands of jobs and the interarrival times of 							jobs as random 	variables. 
				\end{itemize}		  
	\end{itemize}	    
    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Open Networks: Example}
    \framesubtitle{\textbf{\textit{Network of Queues with Probabilistic Routing}}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Server $i$ receives external arrivals (“outside arrivals”) with rate $r_i$ .
		\item Server i also receives internal arrivals from some of the other servers. 
		\item A packet that ﬁnishes service at server $i$ is next routed to server $j$ with 							probability $p_{ij}$ . 
		\item Multiple \textbf{“class”} of the packet, may have different probability according to 			routing scheme

	\begin{itemize}
			
		\item Real application in internet
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Wire delay can be  replaced by a server with some rate matching with dire delay
			\item \textbf{Goal}: is to predict RTT
			\item \textbf{Deterministic Varation}: instead of $P_{ij}$, specific path to next 						server
			\end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Goal of Queueing Theory}
    \framesubtitle{\textbf{\textit{2 Goals}}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Predicting the system perfor- mance. Ex. 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item predicting mean delay or delay variability in service   
			\item number of jobs that will be in queue 
			\item mean number of servers being utilized
			\end{itemize}
		\item Developing design of improved system
		\item Example
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Can we build a better system from 1 slow discs or one faster disc
			\item 
			\end{itemize}
